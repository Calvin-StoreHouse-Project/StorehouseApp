# StoreHouse Inventory Control

This is the repository for the senior project of Nate Minderhoud, Coleman Ulry, and Jacob Williams. We have partnered with a Grand Rapids, MI based non-profit organization called the StoreHouse, who seek to receive donations from various sources and distribute them to those in need. Our goal is to provide them with a prototype of what a inventory control system could like look.
